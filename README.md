# markdown-serve-examples

Samples for using [markdown-serve](https://github.com/lyphtec/markdown-serve)

Each sample is a standalone Express app.  To run, just do something like:

```js
$ node simple-middleware/app.js
```

The `common` folder contains files shared across most samples.  The primary location of the markdown files used by all samples is at
`common/data`.
